          <p>
            The Digital Profession was established through a recommendation from
            the APS Review (Thodey) to 'professionalise the Australian Public
            Service'. The Digital Profession team at the DTA approached this
            product using the Service Design and Delivery Process (SDDP) to
            uncover the user needs that sit behind this high level
            recommendation. I have worked in the small Digital Profession MDT
            since its inception and as such have had deep involvement in the
            discovery/research phase, as well as establishing and iterating our
            service offering.
          </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            "Will an 'APS Digital Profession' help to create a genuinely
            compelling offer that both attracts and retains talented digital and
            technology roles within the public sector?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital and technology professionals are in high demand in all
            sectors, but especially in the public sector. Strong competition
            from private industry, particularly around remuneration, and the
            requirement for somewhat legacy skills and knowledge in the public
            sector, leaves us struggling to get, and keep, the capabilities we
            need. The intention of the Digital Profession is to prioritise the
            development and retention of this talent, through more than just
            salary.

            Discovery: Gaining a deep understanding of the users and their
            needs, and developing hypotheses to solve the problems
          </h3>
          <p>
            3 workshops and 36 user research sessions on a broad range of topics
            from developmental programs and learning styles to platform ideation
            and testing. This user research was coupled with desktop research on
            professional associations, capability building in the 21st century
            and workplace culture. With support from the broader team, I planned
            and co-facilitated the 3 workshops, prepared the user research plans
            and facilitated some of the user research sessions. I also
            synthesised the data from these sessions to form assets including
            our customer journey map, service blueprint and ecosystem map as
            well as actionable insights for the broader team to respond to.

            In this series of research sessions, we heard time and time again
            that our users often felt their skills were misunderstood; not
            recognised; and/or misused in their agencies. This frequently led to
            them having duties that were not suited to their skills, separation
            from their specialisation and below industry standard remuneration.
            These three issues became our guiding pain points, providing a
            strong evidential base for all the products and services under the
            Digital Profession banner. We also heard from this research that the
            priorities of our users were: professional standards; community;
            talent recognition and management; mobility; and foundational
            digital skills uplift. Our hypothesis was that these pain points and
            priorities could be addressed through the adoption of a common
            skills framework, supported by a community and career pathway data.
            To date we have shaped all our deliverables around the insights from
            this research.

          <h3>Alpha: Developing, mapping and testing</h3>
          <p>
            My focus for the first 6 months of 2021 was to test the community
            aspect of our hypothesis. Our ambition for this product is that it
            will provide our users with a central place to record skills and
            continuing professional development activities, connect with other
            digital professionals and access events, training and guidance
            materials. Our point of differentiation from similar products
            offered by their employing agencies is that this record would follow
            them throughout their public service career. This community would
            accompany our Career Pathfinder product, which I worked on in 2020.
            Together they would bring a standardised skills framework (SFIA)
            into the mix to provide our users and their agencies clarity around
            roles and skills, in direct response to the pain points heard in our
            research.

          Without access to a full time developer, we were limited to finding a
          customisable software as a service product. Using the insights from
          our user research and journey mapping, I researched and tested over a
          dozen potential products and services. During the process I also took
          it upon myself to learn basic front-end development skills to ensure
          our team had the skills required to implement the chosen product. Once
          selected, I spent time learning the product, creating more detailed
          journey maps and service blueprints that brought to life the steps our
          users would take, and everything they would encounter along the way. I
          identified steps that would need manual intervention in the short
          term, to ensure we were prepared for any administrative burden. I then
          mapped our entire service offering, to show our executive team how our
          products and services connected, and suggested ideas to improve this
          offering.

          <h3>The [beta] solution</h3>
          <p>
            The beta pilot of the new Digital Profession offering, underpinned
            by the members community, launched in June and is so far meeting or
            exceeding all expectations of both key user groups, digital
            professionals in the APS and the agencies that employ them.
          </p>
          <p>
            For APS digital professionals our solutions provide them with
            recognition as a Digital Practitioner via a profile that showcases
            their skills and a verifiable digital badge. They can build networks
            through access to communities of other practitioners, on member only
            forums. They receive priority and early access to professional
            development opportunities, events and networking as well as member
            only events. They can access short-term, flexible mobility
            opportunities to build skills and experience across the APS.
          </p>
          <p>
            For agencies, we are providing value through the creation of a
            database that can be used to baseline skills of digital staff as
            well as digital roles across the APS. We are providing visibility
            and assurance of the digital practitioners they have and common
            language/framework to help them understand the skills those
            practitioners have. This then allows more structure in performance
            management conversations through a deeper understanding of digital
            roles and skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 12 months up to June 2021 we had 1500 members join, while in
            the last 2 months we have already had 700 new members join. I have
            been working closely with members of my team to continually iterate,
            test and develop this site as we move towards our live product.
